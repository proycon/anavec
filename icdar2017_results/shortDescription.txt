Anavec is a spelling correction system that stores words or ngrams from a lexicon and background corpus as **anagram
vectors**, an unordered bag-of-characters model. Words to be corrected are similarly represented as anagram vectors and
matched with the training data to find the closest neigbours. Anagram matches are resolved to actual correction
candidates, which are in turn scored according to the Vector distance, Levenshtein distance, frequency in background
corpus, and presence in lexicon. Finally, a stack decoder algorithm (a beam search) incorporating also a Language Model
component for context sensitivity, selects the most likely correction candidates given an input sequence.

We trained this system with little to no regard for historical spelling to keep things simple; using Wikipedia as the
background corpus and the lexicon from Aspell. Our system does both detection and correction, but we focussed mainly on
task 2. For task 1 we only participate for French as the English version has too many false positives as it is not aware
of historical variants.
